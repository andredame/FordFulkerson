This repository contains my implementation of Ford Fulkerson's algorithm.

## Story 
Ford Fulkerson's algorithm was developed by Lester Randolph Ford, Jr. and Delbert Ray Fulkerson. The algorithm is designed to find the maximum flow in a flow network.

#### A bit of history â€“ it is always good  

The origin of the interest in maximum flow and minimum cut problems can be traced back to the **Cold War** era. The United States Air Force, particularly concerned about the Soviet Union Railway System, sought to understand the minimum set of railway tracks that, if disrupted, would completely halt movement between the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe during a bombing. This historical context led to the development and study of maximum flow and minimum cut problems, offering a mathematical framework for optimizing the disruption of transportation networks during conflicts. These algorithms have since found applications beyond military contexts in various fields, such as transportation and communication networks.
